# Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Code
This repository contains the code for detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using deep learning techniques. The project employs state-of-the-art pre-trained models and includes the necessary preprocessing steps and evaluation metrics.

**Features**
1. Utilizes pre-trained models such as TensorFlow Hub modules for detection.
2. Implements an end-to-end pipeline for training and testing datasets.
3. Includes customizable hyperparameter configurations for improved performance.

**Dependencies**
The following Python libraries are required to run the code:
1. TensorFlow
2. TensorFlow Hub
3. os
4. Other dependencies can be installed via the requirements.txt file (to be added if necessary).
